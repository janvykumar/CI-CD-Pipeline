## Overview

Welcome to our comprehensive CI/CD pipeline repository! Here, we provide a complete guide to setting up and understanding every stage of the CI/CD process. From integrating SonarQube for code quality analysis, Nexus for artifact management, and Maven for builds, to exploring other essential plugins, our repository aims to equip with practical knowledge.
By the end of this journey, we'll not only master application-level CI/CD setups but also delve into system-level monitoring using Prometheus and Grafana. We will be deploying Board Game Database Full-Stack Web Application using CI/CD Pipeline and finally set up monitoring for our Application and for jenkins.
